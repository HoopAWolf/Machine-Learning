Steps to start the game: 
1) Import Pygames and NEAT libraries through command prompt
2) Run the game using command prompt

Controls:
DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT arrow keys to control car
UP is default control without any inputs

UP -> Go Forward
DOWN -> Reverse
Left -> Turn left
Right -> Turn right

Important Variables:
- IsRecording boolean variable -> True to record user inputs, False to NOT record user inputs
- IsRanFromData boolean variable -> True if player car is being played back through external dataset
- IsRanFromAIData boolean variable -> True if player car is being played back through AI generated external dataset

- population.run(MainSimulationLoop, #NUMBER OF GENERATIONS) -> Change the parameter to run #NUMBER of times

Files are written into: 
- Regressive Decision Tree will read from dataset in file all_ai_best_data.csv
- Q-learning NEAT dataset will be written into file ai_data.csv
- Player input dataset will be written into data.csv

To run AI data:
- Change IsRanFromAIData to True
